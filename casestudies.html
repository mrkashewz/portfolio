  <h2 class="title2"> Research (SWOT Analysis & Problems and Solutions) </h1>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p class="researchtext">
        YouCreate is a Software as a Service application which allows users to share content with others. After receiving feedback through surveys, we’ve gathered some information about our participant’s preferences and predispositions when using the internet. The next stage in creating YouCreate is to analyze the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (the SWOT system) of 3 of our top competitors once the app is launched. This well help us better understand what we need to work on as well as fix in our own app. Our three top Software as Service competitors are Dropbox, Google Drive, and Box.
      </p>
    <h3>Studying Our Competition</h3>
        <p class="researchtext">
        Dropbox is a popular application that allows users to share folders and other content online. One of its strengths is that allows synching of folders. This allows users to work on their projects on their desktop and it will automatically synch to Dropbox once they save their file. This saves the user a few steps of manually uploading their files to Dropbox. This makes the process simple for the user. Dropbox also has a simplistic UX design, which in this case doesn’t help it. The icons for the folders are also a little too small. They also have ads on the top of the page which distract the user from finding the call to action. It should instead be placed on the sides of the page or bottom. I think Dropbox would benefit from a messaging feature and a synching option for mobile devices. Dropbox’s biggest threat at the moment is Google Drive which is used more by users.
Google Drive is a popular content sharing service created by Google. It’s easy to use and its folder customization and UX design is simple and easy to use. It also allows users to use up to 15 GB in their free plan. One weakness that Google Drive is its package functionality with Google. Because other Google accounts such as Gmail, Youtube and Chrome are linked to Google Drive, signing out of accounts often becomes a hassle. Google Drive could benefit from a notes or chat functionality. Google Drive’s biggest threat are softwares that’s primary use is content sharing such as Box (rather than PART of a package like Google Drive).
Box is a relatively unknown yet effective software as a service app. Its UX design is clean and very professional looking. One of the downsides of this app is that it isn’t free to use (there is a 14 day trial but however after that users will have to buy a premium plan). This reduces the buy-in rate. There should atleast be a basic membership option like Google Drive which allows the opportunity to upgrade to a premium membership. Box would benefit from more advertisement as it is not well known in comparison to the other apps discussed such as Dropbox and Google Drive.

      Here are my inital sketches of YouCreate's logo.

          During the process of designing YouCreate, user testing became of importance as I wanted to make sure YouCreate was user-friendly. In the example below, I conducted an A/B testing to see which version of the "Add button" a potential user might prefer. The test was performed on the site ,"Peek , and results showed that users preferred the second prototype.

  <h1 class="title1"> Lotus Teas Case Study</h1>
  <div class="research">
  <h2 class="title2"> Research (Summary, Problems & Solutions) </h1>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p class="researchtext">
      Lotus teas emerged in response to the stagnant Chinese tea market in America. Its aim is to provide an authentic experience of Chinese teas to the Western world. Users can order Chinese loose-leaf teas with a simple click of a button on Lotus Tea's website!
      </p>
    <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p class="researchtext">
      The tea market in the United States isn’t well established, more specifically the emphasis on Chinese tea. The tea that most people know about come from large commercialized companies such as Starbucks and Teavana. Many of these companies often falsely advertise their teas to be “authentic” and almost always adulterate the teas by adding sweeteners or other additives that take away from the quality of the tea. Many tea stores that specialize in Chinese tea are often overlooked as they don’t focus on their marketing, UX and their brand compared to the big corporations.  By creating Lotus Teas, we can deliver fresh unadulterated Chinese traditional teas to the public.
      </p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p class="researchtext">
      The solution to this aforementioned problem is to focus on our branding and marketing skills, two aspects Chinese tea stores in the United States often neglect. In addition, by explaining the health benefits of the teas (something Starbucks and Teavana hasn’t done) we can attract customers who want to drink a tasty beverage which is also in turn good for their health!

  <div class="research">
  <h2 class="title2"> Summary and Research</h1>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p class="researchtext">
      PayCrave is a food truck app that allows users to find and order from food trucks in their area. Users also have the option of creating an account, placing a review on a particular food truck, adding or removing payment methods and reviewing purchase history.
      </p>
    <h3>Research</h3>
        <p class="researchtext">
      PayCrave's userflow was inspired by many of today's popular social apps such as Yelp, UberEats and Lyft. For instance, the reviews feature at the bottom of food truck's menu was a concept borrowed from Yelp's review/rating system. This is an important feature as first-time customers would have an informed opinion of the food truck before ordering. This feature has sadly not been implemented in popular food delivery apps such as Caviar or UberEats.
