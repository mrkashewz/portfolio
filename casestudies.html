    <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p class="researchtext">
        YouCreate is a Software as a Service application which allows users to share content with others. After receiving feedback through surveys, we’ve gathered some information about our participant’s preferences and predispositions when using the internet. The next stage in creating YouCreate is to analyze the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (the SWOT system) of 3 of our top competitors once the app is launched. This well help us better understand what we need to work on as well as fix in our own app. Our three top Software as Service competitors are Dropbox, Google Drive, and Box.
      </p>
    <h2>Studying Our Competition</h2>
        <p class="researchtext">
        Dropbox is a popular application that allows users to share folders and other content online. One of its strengths is that allows synching of folders. This allows users to work on their projects on their desktop and it will automatically synch to Dropbox once they save their file. This saves the user a few steps of manually uploading their files to Dropbox. This makes the process simple for the user. Dropbox also has a simplistic UX design, which in this case doesn’t help it. The icons for the folders are also a little too small. They also have ads on the top of the page which distract the user from finding the call to action. It should instead be placed on the sides of the page or bottom. I think Dropbox would benefit from a messaging feature and a synching option for mobile devices. Dropbox’s biggest threat at the moment is Google Drive which is used more by users.
Google Drive is a popular content sharing service created by Google. It’s easy to use and its folder customization and UX design is simple and easy to use. It also allows users to use up to 15 GB in their free plan. One weakness that Google Drive is its package functionality with Google. Because other Google accounts such as Gmail, Youtube and Chrome are linked to Google Drive, signing out of accounts often becomes a hassle. Google Drive could benefit from a notes or chat functionality. Google Drive’s biggest threat are softwares that’s primary use is content sharing such as Box (rather than PART of a package like Google Drive).
Box is a relatively unknown yet effective software as a service app. Its UX design is clean and very professional looking. One of the downsides of this app is that it isn’t free to use (there is a 14 day trial but however after that users will have to buy a premium plan). This reduces the buy-in rate. There should atleast be a basic membership option like Google Drive which allows the opportunity to upgrade to a premium membership. Box would benefit from more advertisement as it is not well known in comparison to the other apps discussed such as Dropbox and Google Drive.

      Here are my inital sketches of YouCreate's logo. Since the app is a file-sharing app, I wanted to invoke feelings of community and trust through my logo. the first starred item represents unity as the letters Y and C join and become one. The bottom starred logo sketch displays the letters in a representation of a home. The middle starred logo of a Venn Diagram was the logo I finally chose. The letters represent two different ideas coming together and merging as one which I felt aptly described YouCreate.

      Below you will see the logo in its final stage.
